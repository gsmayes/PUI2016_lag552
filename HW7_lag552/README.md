# HOMEWORK 7: Plotting Practice

*Contribution:* I worked on this assignment alone.

*Summary:* For this assignment, I thought it would be interesting to plot some data on violence among inmates in NYC, so I pulled two data sets from NYC Open Data. The first has inmate population from 2001 to 2010, and the second has inmate stabbing/slashing incidents from the same time frame. I merged these datasets then formed a scatterplot of the two variables (population vs. incidents) to see their relationship visually. I added a best fit line to this data to enhance the information it was presenting. While the visual data suggested a possible positive correlation, the significance of such cannot be concluded without further statistical testing.
