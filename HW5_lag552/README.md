#Homework 5

##Assignment 1

**Contribution:** Worked with Nonie Mathur, Santiago Carillo, and Alexey Kalinin. Alexey and Santiago helped me understand some of the test code set-up; also Dr. Bianco helped me troubleshoot some of the graphing issues. Santiago, Nonie, and I worked together through most of this. 

**Process:** I used the K-S and A-D tests to see if the age distribution of citibike riders fit either a normal or logistic distribution. Part of the process involved pulling the mean and standard deviation from the age data in order to run the K-S scipy.stats.ks function arguments correctly. I ultimately rejected the null hypotheses for both tests under both model distributions, determining that the age distribution did not fit either a normal or logistic distribution. 

##Assignment 2

**Contribution:** Worked with Kristi Korsberg through most of this, who shared her code with me. I helped her understand the matrix scatterplot interpretation. Also worked with Nonie and Santiago and shared some of what Kristi showed me with them. 

**Process:** Looked at income data by gender and race to examine income disparity between men and women. First, we plotted a scatter matrix of several variables from the dataset against each other, looking for trends in things like income amount and disparity, separated by gender. This exploratory data didn't show much difference between the genders. However, once we plotted income by race of men vs. women, the disparity became clear, and best fit lines and regression models showed that women make less then men in all race groups. 

##Assignment 3

**Contribution:** I worked through on my own first, then discussed it with Nonie and Santiago. I also offered Kristi some guidance on this section.

**Process:** Simply writing null hypothesis and equations for several experimental setups.
