*1. Do diets help lose more fat than exercise? Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.*

**Null Hypothesis:** An average person who diets loses significantly less or equal fat compared to a person who exercises, alpha = 0.05.

**H0 Formula:** Fat loss (diet group) <= Fat loss (exercise group)

*2. Do American trust the president? POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.*

**Null Hypothesis:** The same or lower percentage of Americans trust the president (Bill Clinton) than those who do not, alpha = 0.05. 

**H0 Formula:** % Americans who trust Bill Clinton <= % Americans who do not trust Bill Clinton

*3. Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.*

**Null Hypothesis:** The cessation rate of smokers using nicotine patches is the same or less than the cessation rate of smokers using placebo patches, alpha = 0.05.

**H0 Formula:** Cessation rate of smokers (nicotine patches) <= Cessation rate of smokers (placebo patches)

*4. Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.*

**Null Hypothesis:** Children born to smoking mothers have the same or higher IQs in early childhood than children born to nonsmoking mothers, alpha = 0.05.

**H0 Formula:** Children's IQ (born to smoking mothers) >= Children's IQ (born to nonsmoking mothers)
