**Contribution:** I worked on this assignment independently (due to scheduling restraints). 

**Assignnment Scope:** This literature review involved finding two scientific articles using a test to see the difference betweeen groups and using a test to look for relationships between the IV and DVs, respectively. I chose a t-test for my first paper, and looked at an article about how bacterial diversity varies between asthmatic smokers and healthy non-smokers, and also how bacterial diversity varies amoung asthmatic smokers who quit smoking and those who do not. This study was technically an exploratory one, though they did perform analysis in their results, so it was a little difficult to determine hypothesis and alpha values, but I explain this in the table below. As a notes, their conclusion was that asthmatic smokers do have more bacterial diversity, but there was no significant difference in this group between quitters and non-quitters. My second study was one using multiple linear regression to look at the relationship between a specific peptide level and bone mineral density in U.S. citizens. It ultimately determined a significant negative linear relationship between these variables. 

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
T-test	| 2, Health/Smoking Status (Tobacco smokers with asthma vs. non-smoking healthy controls); Cessation Status (Cigarette quitting vs. non-quitting asthma patients) | categorical | 1, bacterial diversity (count) | continuous | 2, patients had not experienced lower respiratory tract infections in the last 3 months; patients had not received treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids in the last 3 months | categorical | 1. Does bacterial diversity differ between asthmatic smokers and healthy non-smokers? 2. Does bacterial diversity decrease in cigarette-quitting asthmatic smokers vs. non-quitting asthmatic smokers? | This was an exploratory study, so no pre-specified null hypothesis was stated; only said "smoking cessation is associated with changes in bacterial diversity"; if stated, the null would likely be: bacterial diversity after cessation >= bacterial diversity without cessation | Used p-value = 0.05 in analysis | [Smoking Cessation and the Microbiome in Induced Sputum Samples from Cigarette Smoking Asthma Patients](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158622) |
Multiple Regression	| 1, serum C-peptide level | continous | 1, bone mineral density (BMD) (in g/cm^2) | continuous | 4, age; sex; ALP, FPG, and serum insulin levels; and BMI | both categorical (sex; ALP, FBG, and insulin levels; possibly age and BMI) and continous (possibly age and BMI) | Is serum C-peptide level associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in residents of the United States? | No significant correlation (specifically, linear relationship) between serum c-peptide levels and BMD; H0: Î²1 (the slope of the linear relationship) = 0 | None stated in the beginning, but used p = 0.01 in analysis | [The Association between the Serum C-Peptide Level and Bone Mineral Density](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083107) |
