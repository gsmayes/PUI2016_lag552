T-test	| 2, Health/Smoking Status (Tobacco smokers with asthma vs. non-smoking healthy controls); Cessation Status (Cigarette quitting vs. non-quitting asthma patients) | categorical | 1, bacterial diversity (count) | continuous | 2, patients had not experienced lower respiratory tract infections in the last 3 months; patients had not received treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids in the last 3 months | categorical | 1. Does bacterial diversity differ between asthmatic smokers and healthy non-smokers? 2. Does bacterial diversity decrease in cigarette-quitting asthmatic smokers vs. non-quitting asthmatic smokers? | This was an exploratory study, so no pre-specified null hypothesis was stated; only said "smoking cessation is associated with changes in bacterial diversity"; if stated, the null would likely be: bacterial diversity after cessation >= bacterial diversity without cessation | Used p-value = 0.05 in analysis | [Smoking Cessation and the Microbiome in Induced Sputum Samples from Cigarette Smoking Asthma Patients](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0158622) |
Multiple Regression	| 1, serum C-peptide level | continous | 1, bone mineral density (BMD) (in g/cm^2) | continuous | 4, age; sex; ALP, FPG, and serum insulin levels; and BMI | both categorical (sex; ALP, FBG, and insulin levels; possibly age and BMI) and continous (possibly age and BMI) | Is serum C-peptide level associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in residents of the United States? | No significant correlation (specifically, linear relationship) between serum c-peptide levels and BMD; H0: Î²1 (the slope of the linear relationship) = 0 | None stated in the beginning, but used p = 0.01 in analysis | [The Association between the Serum C-Peptide Level and Bone Mineral Density](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083107) |
