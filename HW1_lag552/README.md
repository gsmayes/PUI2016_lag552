## Assignment II Description

**Contribution:** 

I worked in a group with Nonie Mathur & Santiago Carillo. Santiago helped me work through creating the environmental variable and the alias, as well as troubleshooting some issues I ran into with the .bashrc command. I helped Santiago and Nonie create their PUI2016 repos on github and the README.md files through compute. Generally, we worked together through the assignment.

**Process Summary:** 

I created the environmental variable PUI2016 so that it linked to the directory, then created the alias pui2016 that would take me to that directory. I had to use the soure .bashrc command to reset and then make a couple edits in the bash file to get this to work.

This successfully created the pui2016 alias, which I checked using the pwd function.

## Assignment III Description

**Contribution:** 

I worked with Laura Bligh on the extra credit assignment. Specifically, she helped me with the first step and with the challenge portion at the end. I also got help from Aviral Somvanshi, who helped me create the code for the second step and explained what it was doing and rendering (and also how to view the arrays to check my work). I figured out how to created the plots visually and helped Laura with that too (and she gave me her own ideas).

**Process Summary:** 

I first gave numpy as a seed for the code so it could be reproducible. Then I simply followed the steps to create the 2x100 random arrays in gaussian distribution, then created 50 of these and the plots as described.
