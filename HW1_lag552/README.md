## Assignment II Description

**Contribution:** I worked in a group with Nonie Mathur & Santiago Carillo. Santiago helped me work through creating the environmental variable and the alias, as well as troubleshooting some issues I ran into with the .bashrc command. I helped Santiago and Nonie create their PUI2016 repos on github and the README.md files through compute. 

**My Process:** 
1. I created the environmental variable PUI2016 so that it linked to the directory, then created the alias pui2016 that would take me to that directory. I had to use the soure .bashrc command to reset and then make a couple edits in the bash file to get this to work.

2. This successfully created the pui2016 alias, which I checked using the pwd function.
