#HOMEWORK 3

##Contribution: 
I worked in a group with Nonie Mathur, Santiago Carrillo, Maisha Lopa, and Alexey Kalinin. We worked through Assignments 
2 & 3 together. I mainly got help from them with coding issues, while I feel my greatest contribution was explaining the statistics 
behind the problems to the others. For Assignment 1, we mainly worked alone but I did reach out to my group via email as questions came up. 

#Assignment 1

##Summary: 
For this assignment, I created distributions of 100 sample means of different sizes for five different types of distributions.
I could see the Central Limit Theorem at play, since my plots showed the larger the sample size, the closer the sample mean was to the true
population mean. I also saw how these plots approximated normal distributions.

#Assignment 2

##Summary: 
Our group came up with a hypothesis that younger Citi Bike users are more likely to ride for longer durations compared to the
overall population. We then looked at distributions by age and by trip duration, as well as plotting the two against each other. 

#Assignment 3

##Summary: 
For this assignment, we simply imported the bus time data for the new line, found its mean and standard deviation, and
calculated the z-statistic (score) using the known mean and standard deviation of the population. We then interpreted the z-statistic
and were able to reject our null hypothesis.
