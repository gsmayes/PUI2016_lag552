# Review of the HW3_Assignment 2_lag552 FROM xy1002

a. The Null and Alternative hypothesis in sentences are formulated correctly. In the equation, however, she didn't specify which data of trip duration that she was going to compare, average trip duration for riders under 35? or total trip duration for riders under 35?

b. She ploted all kinds of distribution of the data, they all made a great visulization of the data set, which can also show the relationship between different variables. Yet she didn't pre-process the data to support or reject her Null Hypothesis, like using the birth year to get the age of all riders, or caculating whatever statistic value of the trip duration that can be used to verify her Hypothesis. 

c. We can use Z-test to test $H_0$ since we are looking at differences between the sample and the population, maybe means of tripduration (riders under 35 years old/ all riders).
